DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SERVER
=====================================

PROBLEM: When you double-click deploy.bat on the server, it opens in text editor instead of running.

SOLUTIONS:

Option 1: Use run-deploy.cmd (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------
- Double-click "run-deploy.cmd" instead of "deploy.bat"
- This file will properly execute the deployment script

Option 2: Run from Command Prompt
----------------------------------
1. Right-click in the folder where deploy.bat is located
2. Select "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell window here"
3. Type: deploy.bat
4. Press Enter

Option 3: Change File Association (Advanced)
--------------------------------------------
1. Right-click on deploy.bat
2. Select "Open with" > "Choose another app"
3. Select "Command Prompt" or "Windows Command Processor"
4. Check "Always use this app to open .bat files"

Option 4: For Linux Servers
---------------------------
- Use deploy.sh instead of deploy.bat
- Make it executable: chmod +x deploy.sh
- Run: ./deploy.sh

WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES:
====================
✓ Clears all Laravel caches
✓ Optimizes for production (caches config, routes, views)
✓ Runs database migrations
✓ Creates storage symbolic link
✓ Shows completion status

IMPORTANT NOTES:
===============
- Make sure PHP is installed and accessible from command line
- Ensure you have proper file permissions
- Update your .env file with production settings before running
- Test the deployment script in a staging environment first
