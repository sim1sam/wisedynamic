# Payment System Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the payment system and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure payment environment.

## Security Features Implemented

1. **SSL Certificate Verification**
   - All communication with payment gateways is verified using SSL certificates
   - CURL connections have `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` enabled

2. **Secure Transaction IDs**
   - Transaction IDs use cryptographically secure random bytes
   - Format: `WD{timestamp}{random_bytes}`

3. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Payment gateway callbacks are restricted to authorized IPs
   - Unauthorized IPs are logged and blocked

4. **Fraud Detection**
   - Suspicious transactions are automatically flagged or blocked
   - Multiple failed attempts trigger additional verification
   - Unusual payment patterns are detected

5. **Payment Audit Logging**
   - All payment actions are logged for audit purposes
   - Logs include user information, IP addresses, and transaction details

6. **Rate Limiting**
   - Payment endpoints are protected by rate limiting
   - Failed attempts reduce the rate limit threshold

7. **Secure Session Management**
   - Sessions are encrypted and regenerated during payment flows
   - Secure, HTTP-only cookies with SameSite protection

8. **Content Security Policy**
   - Restricts which domains can load resources
   - Prevents XSS attacks

## Security Guidelines

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Keep `.env` file secure and never commit to version control
   - Use different API keys for development and production

2. **Test Files**
   - Remove or secure test files in production
   - Block access to test files using `.htaccess` rules

3. **Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Regularly update SSL Commerz IP whitelist
   - Validate all payment gateway responses

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use sanitized error messages for users
   - Log detailed errors for debugging

5. **Regular Audits**
   - Review payment audit logs regularly
   - Monitor for unusual payment patterns

6. **SSL Certificate**
   - Ensure the server has a valid SSL certificate
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings

## Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Disable the payment system immediately
2. Investigate the audit logs
3. Contact the payment gateway provider
4. Follow the incident response plan
